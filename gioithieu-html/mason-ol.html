                        <h3>Mason was top scorer in the Under-18 Premier League North in 2017/18, while still a schoolboy and being eligible for Under-16 level.</h3>
                        <h3>The enterprising forward is equally adept with both feet and capable of creating chances out of nothing. Evolving from a no.10 to more of a centre-forward, he looked the part as the cutting edge of an entertaining team.</h3>
                        <h3>He finished the season with 17 goals from 17 starts, plus a further four outings as a substitute, and was awarded Player of the Tournament when the Reds won the ICGT trophy in the Netherlands, despite being the youngest member of the squad.</h3>
                        <h3>A call-up for the senior squad's Tour 2018, presented by Aon, in the United States showed the high regard in which he is held as he enjoyed playing and working under Jose Mourinho and his coaching staff, including his former Under-18s boss Kieran McKenna.</h3>
                        <h3>The England Under-18 international enjoyed a goal-filled start to the campaign for the Under-18s, and the Under-19s in the UEFA Youth League, it was announced on 2 October that Mason had signed his first professional contract with the club as reward for his efforts.</h3>
                        <h3> Senior debuts cannot come on much bigger platforms than at the Parc des Princes in the key second leg of a knockout Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain in March, 2019. After being on the bench previously, this was his first taste of men's football and he celebrated with fellow Academy graduate Marcus Rashford when the no.10 slammed in the injury-time penalty that took Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Reds through.</h3>
                        <h3>Solskjaer also introduced the teenager off the bench at Arsenal, while his first start came in the final game of the Premier League season against Cardiff City at Old Trafford. The youngster had a number of chances to score and was impressive, despite a 2-0 defeat. In May, he was the clear winner of the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award.</h3>
                        <h3>A second successive place on the senior tour, in the summer of 2019, suggested he would push for a first-team place and he netted his first senior goals, against Leeds United and Inter Milan, to promote his claims. After moving to shirt no.26, he had a taste of the action in both United's opening home (Chelsea) and away (Wolves) fixtures in the Premier League.</h3>
                        <h3>In September 2019, Greenwood became our youngest-ever goalscorer in European competition, netting against FC Astana in the Europa League at Old Trafford 12 days before his 18th birthday. He followed that strike up with his first goal for the Reds in domestic competition when he opened the scoring in the Rochdale Carabao Cup tie a week later. In what was a landmark month for the Bradford-born teenager, he also made his debut for Aidy Boothroyd's England Under-21s in a European qualifier against Turkey.</h3>
                        <h3>A first goal for England Under-21s followed in November 2019, away to the Netherlands, and, days later, he got off the mark in the Premier League with a predatory effort during the 3-3 draw at Sheffield United. The records kept tumbling for the talented forward as he went on to score 17 in all competitions for the first team - equalling the best-ever campaign by a Reds teenager.</h3>
                        <h3>Full international recognition followed for Mason in September 2020, when he made his England debut as a substitute during the UEFA Nations League clash with Iceland.</h3>
                        <h3>Greenwood signed a new deal in February 2021, keeping him at the club until at least 2025 and reached the milestone of 100 appearances for the Reds when appearing against Roma in the Europa League semi-final second leg.</h3>
